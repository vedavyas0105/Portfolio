# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository, showcasing my skills and experience as a developer/data scientist/etc.. This project is designed to highlight the projects I’ve worked on, the technologies I’m proficient in, and provide insight into my professional journey. The portfolio includes a home page with a brief introduction, a projects section featuring key work with links to GitHub repos and live demos, a skills section, and a contact form for inquiries. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s fully responsive and deployed on GitHub. To run this project locally, clone the repo, navigate to the directory, install dependencies if applicable, and start the development server. Feel free to explore and reach out to me via email at vvyas.b@gmail.com or connect on LinkedIn. Thanks for visiting!
